# Body Mass Index(BMI) Calculator. 

PROBLEM - many people don't know how to calculate the BMI and they don't know how to navigate through results.

SOLUTION - the program can help to find the BMI and also print short advice and result od this index. 
I used 4 packages - math(for calculating the formula of bmi), fmt(for printing), testing(for testing:) ), net/http(for making http requests and server).
So when the program gets compiled the server starts at port :8080, then the bmi function gets called and it calculates BMI and prints the index and result on the web page.
